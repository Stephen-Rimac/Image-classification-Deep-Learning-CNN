This Jupyter notebook will help aspiring data scientists learn and practice the necessary python code needed for creating a world-class deep learning image classifier using a convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm.

The following notebook contains notes and python code. I adapted the code to my own needs but code was originally developed by [Jeremy Howard](http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), co-founder of [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai).
