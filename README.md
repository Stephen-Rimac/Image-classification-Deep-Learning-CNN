This Jupyter notebook will help aspiring data scientists learn and practice the necessary python code needed for creating a world-class image classifier using a convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm.

The following notebook contains notes and python code, compiled from a lecture given by [Jeremy Howard](http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), co-founder of [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai). Many thanks to Jeremy and [Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/about/#rachel) for building fast.ai and the fastai library, a high-level wrapper for [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). The following code is based on the [fast.ai libary](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/). For more information, watch the first lesson (of seven) in [Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 1](http://course.fast.ai), which is publically available free of charge. If you are keen to learning deep learning, you won't regret it!
