This Jupyter notebook will help aspiring data scientists learn and practice the necessary python code needed for creating a world-class image classifer using a convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm.

The following notebook containis notes and python code, compiled from a lecture given by [Jeremy Howard](http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), co-founder of fast.ai. Many thanks to Jeremy and Rachel Thomas for building fast.ai and the fastai library, a high-level wrapper for PyTorch. The following code is based on the fast.ai libary. For more information, watch the first lesson (of seven) in Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 1, which is publically available free of charge. If you are keen to learning deep learning, you won't regret it!
